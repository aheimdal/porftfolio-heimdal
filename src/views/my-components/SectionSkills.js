              Over the years I have accumulated skills and knowledge in several programming languages and frameworks. My preferred Operating System is Windows but I have experience in using Linux as well. The languages I know the most are Javascript and C# and have some experience in using Java and Python. Frameworks I have gotten to know and have some skill in using are React and Angular, I like React a bit more since there are more documentations and tutorials online to learn something new. I have good grasp on PostgreSQL and MySQL and I do not prefer either one over the other. I have become quite comfortable using Visual Studio Code to do all my work and love all the neat extension that are available to make coding life easier.

              I have also some knowledge in using Unity Game engine and I am interested in learning more on how to use the game engine to develop games.
